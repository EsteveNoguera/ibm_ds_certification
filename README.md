# IBM Data Science certification in Coursera

This is a simple repository saving all deliverables I found interesting in doing during this certification

## Tools for Data Science

### Week 4 lab: create and share your own Jupyter notebook

You can check this notebook clicking [here](https://github.com/EsteveNoguera/IBM_Data_Science_certification/blob/main/tools_for_data_science/lab_week4.ipynb)

### Final deliverable

Quite similar to the previous lab, just with more exercises. For reviewing you can click [here](https://github.com/EsteveNoguera/IBM_Data_Science_certification/blob/main/tools_for_data_science/final_assignment.ipynb)

## Python project for Data Science

This course intends to force the student to show basic Python skills in Data Science learned in a previous course named "Python for Data Science, AI and Development". You can check this project [here](www.somewebsite.com) (soon).
