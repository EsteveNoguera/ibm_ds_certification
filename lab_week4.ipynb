    "*I've always had a very empirical mindset. That's why I think decissions made from extracting knowledge from data are essential to ensure good outcomes. This makes me fall naturally into the Data Science field. I had the chance of working as a bioinformatician trying to model and get a better understanding of leukaemia. I think current advances and world situation can allow me to work from home, giving me the opportunity to get back in bussiness, this time as data scientists or data analyst for a biotech or pharma company*"
