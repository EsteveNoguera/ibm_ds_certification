    "*I've always had a very empirical mindset. That's why I think decissions made from extracting knowledge from data are essential to ensure good outcomes. This makes me fall naturally into the Data Science field. I had the chance of working as a bioinformatician trying to model and get a better understanding of leukaemia. I believe recent advances and developments (a.k.a. covid-19...) are causing enterprises to adapt and allowing people to work from home. This gives me the opportunity to get back in bussiness since I would like to stay in my home island, this time as data scientists or data analyst for a biotech or pharma company*"
